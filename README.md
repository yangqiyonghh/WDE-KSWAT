 
Here is the code for the WDE-KSWAT model (Fortran language).

The calibration and validation process is as follows: 
1. Determine the distribution of karst features in the study area;
2. Compile the WDE-KSWAT code using Visual Studio software to generate the executable file (WDE-KSWAT);
3. Replace the original SWAT model with the generated WDE-KSWAT executable for parameter calibration and validation.
